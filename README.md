# Simple Calculator

A basic calculator program in Python that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is a great starting point for beginners learning Python and understanding basic input/output operations.

## Features
- Adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two numbers.
- User-friendly interface with clear prompts.
- Handles division by zero gracefully.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator.git
   cd simple-calculator
   ```

2. Run the calculator:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Enter the first number.
   - Enter the second number.
   - Select an operation:
     - 1 for Addition
     - 2 for Subtraction
     - 3 for Multiplication
     - 4 for Division

4. View the result of the chosen operation.

## Example
```plaintext
Welcome to the Simple Calculator!
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Select an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): 1

The result of 10.0 + 5.0 is: 15.0
```

## Error Handling
- **Division by Zero**: If the user tries to divide by zero, the program will display an error message instead of crashing.
- **Invalid Input**: If the user enters a non-numeric input, the program will inform them of the error and terminate.
